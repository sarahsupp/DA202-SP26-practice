# Reproducibility Practice Repo

This project analyzes student survey data and makes a quick plot + summary.

## Authors
Files were created by Dr. Sarah Supp and were edited by Calvin Burzynski.

## Quick start
1. Open RStudio
2. Run `analysis.R`
3. The script will create a plot and print results.

## Notes
- The data file is somewhere in the repo or can be found on my personal computer in the C drive.
- If you get errors, try installing whatever packages it asks for.
- It should work on most machines.

## Output
A plot will appear and be saved to your computer.

## Data dictionary (maybe)
- `studentid`: student id
- `major`: student major
- `Hours_Studied`: hours studied
- `ExamScore`: score of exam
- `date`: date of survey
