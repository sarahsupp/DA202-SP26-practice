# Reproducibility Practice Repo

This project analyzes student survey data and makes a quick plot + summary.

## Authors
List name of each code/data author

## Quick start
1. Open RStudio
2. Run `analysis.R`
3. The script will create a plot and print results.

## Notes
- The data file is somewhere in the repo (or on your computer).
- If you get errors, try installing whatever packages it asks for.
- It should work on most machines.

## Output
A plot should appear and maybe be saved to your computer.

## Data dictionary (maybe)
- `studentid`: student id
- `major`: student major
- `Hours_Studied`: hours studied
- `ExamScore`: score
- `date`: date of survey
